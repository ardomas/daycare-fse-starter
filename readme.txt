Daycare FSE Starter
===================

Minimal Full Site Editing theme for the Daycare project.

Installation:
1. Upload the ZIP to wp-content/themes or use the theme uploader in WP admin.
2. Activate the theme.
3. Open Appearance → Editor to customize global styles, templates, and template parts.

Notes:
- Requires WordPress 6.1+ for best FSE support.
- The theme is intentionally minimal. Add blocks, styles, or a child theme as needed.
